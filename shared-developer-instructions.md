Produce one complete candidate production patch and validate it with public tests. Do not edit tests, benchmark instructions, generated version files, or hidden grader material.

## 1. Native Lightweight Tools First (Light Weapons)
- Read and inspect files using native shell commands (`cat`, `head`, `sed`).
- Search plain text within known files or directories using native `grep` / `rg`.
- Modify code strictly using the agent's native patch editor (`apply_patch`).
- For simple, local, single-file bugs with clear context, locate, edit, and verify directly using native shell tools. Do not start broad explorations.

## 2. LSP Semantic Radar (Heavy Weapons: structure, xref, diagnostics)
When the `lsp` namespace is exposed, it provides only three pure semantic tools: `structure`, `xref`, and `diagnostics`.
- `structure`: Locate symbol definitions or document outlines across the workspace when text search is ambiguous or when multiple classes override the same method name:
  * `structure(action="workspace_symbol", query="SymbolName", workspace_language="python")`
  * `structure(action="document_symbol", file_path="relative/path.py")`
- `xref`: Trace callers, references, or call hierarchy across files before modifying shared APIs:
  * `xref(action="references", pos="relative/path.py:line:column")`
  * `xref(action="call_hierarchy", pos="relative/path.py:line:column", direction="incoming")`
- `diagnostics`: Immediately after editing production code, request syntax and static type diagnostics to catch errors before running heavy tests:
  * `diagnostics(file_path="relative/changed.py")`
  * `diagnostics(file_paths=["relative/file1.py", "relative/file2.py"])`

## 3. Anti-Overkill Discipline & Negative Constraints
- Anti-Overkill Rule: Do NOT initiate heavy cross-file explorations for trivial, single-file fixes.
- No redundant tools: Tools such as `file`, `read_file`, `edit`, `patch_edit`, `inspect`, `grep`, or `completion` DO NOT exist in LSP. All file reading, text searching, and editing must use native shell/editor tools.
- Diagnostics focus: Focus on diagnostics introduced by or directly related to your edited code. Do not let pre-existing type warnings in untouched legacy code derail your progress, but ensure your patch introduces zero syntax or type regressions.

## 4. Hard Test Gate & Rapid Verification Loop (Crucial)
1. Reproduce & Locate: Run the reproduction or targeted test first to observe failure; locate exact cause.
2. Edit: Apply minimal necessary changes with `apply_patch`.
3. Quick Type Check: Run `diagnostics` on modified files for instant static validation.
4. Hard Test Gate: Run the targeted test and broader affected public test suites.
   - **MANDATORY**: The targeted test must PASS (0 failures, 0 errors, exit=0).
   - **NEVER** submit a patch if public tests are failing (`exit != 0`). Never treat `git diff --check`, `py_compile`, or clean git status as a substitute for passing tests. If tests fail, fix the logic or revert breaking changes before completing.
